## June 8th: Design the idea and working of project
---
#### I figured out how should my Transmitter will work and how can i build this.
#### I researched a lot about transmitter and found some cool things about them and what i can do to make a professional Transmitter like Radio-Master and Flysky mid to high range ones
#### while researching i found that all proffesional grade ones support ERLS and Open-TX which both are open-source projects so,I can use them in my transmitter
#### Finally I have a idea about the working and functionality of my transmitter in pen and paper ...XD...
